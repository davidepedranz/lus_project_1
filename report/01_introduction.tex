\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Concept tagging is usually defined as the extraction of a sequence of concepts out of a given word se- quence.
A concept represents the smallest unit of meaning that is relevant for a specific task.
The extracted concepts can be used by the following module in the \ac{SLU} pipeline to provide more complex functions,
like, for instace, an automatic system for interactive flights reservation or a personal assistant program.

In this report, we will present a \ac{WFST} generative model to extract concepts for a movie domain build using the OpenFst and OpenGrm NGram libraries.
We will briefly describe the used data set.
Then, we will present the model we choose to implement.
Finally, we will discuss the model implementation and the obtained performances.
