\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Concept tagging can be defined as the extraction of concepts out of a given word sequence,
where a concept represents the smallest unit of meaning that is relevant for a specific task.
The extracted concepts can be used by the following blocks in a \ac{SLU} pipeline to provide more complex functions, for instance, personal vocal assistant or an automatic flights reservation system.

In this report, we will present a \ac{WFST} generative model to extract concepts for a movie domain, build using
the \texttt{OpenFst}\footnote{\url{http://www.openfst.org/twiki/bin/view/FST/WebHome}}
and \texttt{OpenGrm NGram}\footnote{\url{http://www.openfst.org/twiki/bin/view/GRM/NGramLibrary}} libraries.
We will briefly describe the used data set.
Then, we will present the generative model.
Finally, we will discuss the \ac{WFST} implementation and the obtained performances.
