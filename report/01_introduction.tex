\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Concept tagging is usually defined as the extraction of a sequence of concepts out of a given word sequence.
A concept represents the smallest unit of meaning that is relevant for a specific task.
The extracted concepts can be used by the following module in the \ac{SLU} pipeline to provide more complex functions,
like, for instance, an automatic system for interactive flights reservation or a personal assistant program.

In this report, we will present a \ac{WFST} generative model to extract concepts for a movie domain build using
the \texttt{OpenFst}\footnote{\url{http://www.openfst.org/twiki/bin/view/FST/WebHome}}
and \texttt{OpenGrm NGram}\footnote{\url{http://www.openfst.org/twiki/bin/view/GRM/NGramLibrary}} libraries.
We will briefly describe the used data set.
Then, we will present the model we choose to implement.
Finally, we will discuss the model implementation and the obtained performances.
