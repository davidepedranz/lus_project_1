The data set we used is NL-SPARQL, a corpora of sentences from the movie domain.
For each word in the sentences, the \ac{POS} and the word stem are provided as additional features.
The aim is to tag the sentences with the concepts, like the actor name or the movie release date.

The corpora is already divided in the train and test subsets.
The train subset consists of $\input{counts/train.sentences}$ sentences,
for a total of $\input{counts/train.tokens}$ tokens.
The test subset consists of $\input{counts/train.sentences}$ sentences,
for a total of $\input{counts/train.tokens}$ tokens.
\cref{tab:frequencies} show the distribution of the concepts in the corpora.
We can notice that some concepts, like \texttt{director.nationality} and \texttt{award.category},
are very rare in the train set.
The concept \texttt{movie.type} is present only in the test set, so it is very hard for any model to predict it.

The concepts are reported in the \ac{IOB} format.
Each concept can spanw on multiple contingent words:
the \texttt{B-} prefix indicates that the tag is the beginning of a chunk,
the \texttt{I-} prefix indicates that the tag is inside a chunk.
A chunk is delimited by either a \texttt{O} or a \texttt{B-} tag.
The \texttt{O} tag indicates that no concept has been assigned to the given token.
