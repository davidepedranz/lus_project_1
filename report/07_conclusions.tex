\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this assignment, we created a generative model to do concept tagging.
The best model was the 4-gram model with Kneser-Ney smoothing, trained including the words in the \texttt{O} tags to improve the performances of the underlying concepts language model.
The model was able to reach a F1 score of $82.74\%$ on the test set.
